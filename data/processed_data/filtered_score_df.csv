Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens.

"What is a ""bubble"" in the context of GPU training, and why is it important to minimize it?","[' training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble.\nDuring model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles.

What method does DeepSeek implement to address overflow and underflow issues in lower precision computations?,"['igure.</p>\n<p>While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment.

Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted.\nAnother issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later.

What are the two approaches to obtain a model's reasoning responses during evaluation?,"['n.\nNotably , during evaluation, there are two ways to obtain a model’s reasoning responses. One approach is to\nuse the model’s default marked “thinking parts.” For instance, in the case of DeepSeek-R1 , its responses\nalways consist of two distinct parts: a thinking part and a formal answer part, separated by the special tokens\n“<think>” and “</think>.” The output format of OpenAI-o3-mini follows the same structure. While it\nseems natural to consider the thinking part as reasoning, OpenAI-o3-mini omits this by default and other\nmodels, such as Qwen-QWQ ,Baichuan-M1 , andGemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking (FT) , do not make such\na distinction between the reasoning and answer parts. Thus, to standardize reasoning evaluation across all\nmodels, we employ the second approach to obtain reasoning: prompting them with “summarize the reasoning\nstep-by-step” to explicitly instruct them to generate reasoning responses.

GPT-4’s lowered performance in the “(2) El Farol\nBar” game ( 23.0) and the “(5) Diner’s Dilemma” game ( 0.9) stems from its conservative strategies\nfavoring staying at home and spending less money.

What is a Nash Equilibrium in the context of game theory?,"['hose where ∀i∈P|Ai|>2. Meanwhile,\nMulti-Round games involve the same set of players repeatedly engaging in the game, with a record\nof all previous actions being maintained. Simultaneous games satisfy that k= 1, whereas Sequen-\ntialgames have k > 1, indicating players make decisions in a specific order. Games of Perfect\nInformation are characterized by the condition ∀i,j∈P|i̸=jIi=Ij.

However, human\ndecision-making often deviates from this ideal. Empirical studies reveal that human choices fre-\nquently diverge from what the NE predicts (Nagel, 1995). This deviation is attributed to the com-\nplex nature of human decision-making, which involves not only rational analysis but also personal\nvalues, preferences, beliefs, and emotions. By comparing human decision patterns documented in\nprior studies, together with the NE, we can ascertain whether LLMs exhibit tendencies more akin\nto homo economicus or actual human decision-makers, thus shedding light on their alignment with\nhuman-like or purely rational decision-making processes.\n18Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\nB L ITERATURE REVIEW : EVALUATING LLM S WITH GAME THEORY\nEvaluating LLMs through game theory models has become a popular research direction.

How does the performance of GPT-4o change in the Public Goods Game and the Diner’s Dilemma after applying CipherChat?,"['in GPT-4 (Huang et al., 2024b). To assess whether value alignment influences the behav-\nior of LLMs, we evaluate GPT-4o’s performance in behavioral contexts before and after applying\nCipherChat, using the Public Goods Game and the Diner’s Dilemma.\nPrior to CipherChat, GPT-4o achieves scores of 90.91±2.72in the Public Goods Game and 10.7±\n8.3in the Diner’s Dilemma. After the jailbreak, its performance declines to 88.55±2.38and\n7.5±4.1, respectively. This decline reflects GPT-4o’s inherent risk-averse tuning. For instance,\nin the Public Goods Game, GPT-4o prioritizes minimizing losses, reasoning, “If no contribution is\nmade to the public pot, I will have no loss.” Similarly, in the Diner’s Dilemma, it opts for the less\ncostly dish to reduce expenditures. A comparable conservative approach is observed in the El Farol\nBar Game, where GPT-4o tends to avoid the risk of overcrowding by staying home. In conclusion,\nGPT-4o adopts riskier strategies after jailbreak, such as contributing less in the Public Goods Game\nan']","After applying CipherChat, GPT-4o's performance declines in both the Public Goods Game and the Diner’s Dilemma.

What is neural network quantization and what benefits does it offer in model deployment?,"['arXiv:2503.04704v1  [cs.LG]  6 Mar 2025environments where multiple model instances must run concurrently to handle user traffic, leading\nto substantial infrastructure costs and deployment complexity.\nNeural network quantization has emerged as a promising approach to address these deployment chal-\nlenges by reducing resource usage and accelerating inference through lowering the bit precision of\nmodel parameters [Choi et al., 2018, Hubara et al., 2021, Yao et al., 2022, Park et al., 2022, Gholami\net al., 2022]. We can define quantization as a way of reducing data precision from typical 32-bit or\nbfloat16 to smaller bits ( <=8-bit), which in turn lowers the size of the model and speeds up matrix\nmultiplications involved in the attention mechanism.

However, maintaining model performance under reduced precision remains a challenge.",0.9614238610393832
What is a key challenge in applying uniform low-precision quantization to transformer-based models?,"['tion andmixed\nprecision quantization . While uniform precision quantization is widely applied to reduce the size\nof transformer layers in LLMs, its indiscriminate application often leads to significant performance\ndegradation. This degradation occurs because different layers in transformer-based models exhibit\nvarying sensitivity to quantization, necessitating more nuanced approaches [Wang et al., 2018, Cai\nand Vasconcelos, 2020, Zadeh and Moshovos, 2020, Ganesh et al., 2021]. For example, early lay-\ners processing raw input tokens and final layers producing output logits typically require higher\nprecision than intermediate layers.\nRecent research has focused on addressing the challenges posed by outlier activations, which repre-\nsent a key impediment to effective uniform low-precision quantization. Mixed-precision quantiza-\ntion has shown promise in mitigating this issue by maintaining outlier channels at higher precision\n[Dettmers et al., 2022a, Zhao et al., 2024, Ashkboos et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2024]. ']","A key challenge in applying uniform low-precision quantization to transformer-based models is the presence of outlier activations, which can significantly impede effective quantization. Mixed-precision quantization helps address this issue by maintaining outlier channels at higher precision.",1.0
What are some challenges associated with weight-only quantization methods like GPTQ and FineQuant in production environments?,"['r,\nthey typically require access to the entire model for activation distribution analysis, making them im-\npractical in resource-constrained environments [Kim et al., 2023a]. This is why weight-only quan-\ntization represents a more suitable use case for model compression, exemplified by methods like\nGPTQ [Frantar et al., 2022] or FineQuant [Kim et al., 2023c]. GPTQ converts quantized weights\nto float16 during inference for matrix multiplication operations and FineQuant uses a fine-grained\nquantization algorithm that incorporates group-wise quantization and adaptive selection of granu-\nlarity. While these approaches can achieve performance gains through reduced data loading with\nminimal accuracy loss, they present practical limitations in production environments specially in\ndistributed settings. For example, handling long context lengths and batch processing increases the\nmemory footprint of key-value (KV) cache substantially.

What is Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ) and what does it aim to achieve?,"['nificantly. Still, even with these challenges the weight-only\nquantization seems to be a promising approach for the purposes of this paper.
