Second,\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline.

This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training.

In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication.

What method does DeepSeek implement to address overflow and underflow issues in quantization?,"['igure.</p>\n<p>While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted.\nAnother issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later.
